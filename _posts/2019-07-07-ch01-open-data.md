One minute after the Haiti Earthquake in Jan 2010 a man, Patrick Meier from Boston, MA sprung into action to search for his wife in Port Au Prince. This effort quickly evolved into what we know today as digital humanitarianism. Feeling helpless and craving a constant information, Patrick looked first to CNN and then to Social Media. The result in his efforts was a Haiti Crisis Map. This map used social media outlets such as Twitter, Facebook, Skype, and Google to depict places that individuals were “checking in” geographically. The data and information pulled from social media was so vast and in excess that hundreds of volunteers were trained to manage and map it. This effort evolved into a support structure for Search and Rescue teams (SARs) to tap into. The Map was a direct result in life saving efforts that took place to rescue individuals. This effort grew when an SMS number was set up and provided on radio networks bringing even more data and information in. These SMS messages overwhelmed the volunteer teams yet again and messages had to be filtered to include only those with life safety issues that could be acted on. This Chapter closes with the impacts of all those volunteers waiting through traumatic information and the toll that it can take on your physical and psychological state. Remember what FEMA Task Force 3 advises… Take shifts, get sleep, and get a therapist.

## Key Take-Aways:


### Discussion Questions

1. Given that all the information on the GPS phones was utilized to locate those that sending out tweets, and all the research and work was conducted on personal laptops, what happens to all the data once the incident response is over? How is all this data managed today and utilized from the haiti response?
2. Does the timeframe of an organization or individual to stand-up this a system to track disaster information have the same significance as just trying to track data from another source… like the NOAA?
3. What is the most effective way to mine data so that it is quickly actionable for those that need it?
